# Incident Response, Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery

## Module 1: Understand Incident Response

- Breach: the loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure , unauthorized acquisition or any similar occurence where a person other than a authorized user accesses personally identifiable information,
- Event: Any observable occurrence in a network or system.
- Exploit: A Particular Attack. Its named this way because these attacks exploit system vulnerability
- Incident - An event that actually or potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an information system or the information the system processes, stores or transmits.
- Intrusion - A security event, or combination of events, that constitutes a deliberate security incident in which an intruder gains, or attempts to gain, access to a system or system resource without authorization.
- Vulnerability - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source.
- Zero Day Exploits: A previously unknown system vulnerability with the potential of exploitation without risk of detection or prevention because it does not, in general fit recognized patterns.

  Incident Rsponse Plan:

  - Preparation
  - Detection and Analysis
  - Containment, Eradication and Recovery

Four Primary Responsibility for an incident response team:
- Determine the amount and scope of damage caused by the incident.
- Determine whether any confidential information was compromised during the incident.
- Implement any necessary recovery procedures to restore security and recover from incident-related damage.
- Supervise the implementation of any additional security measures necessary to improve security and prevent recurrence of the incident.

The Goal of Disaster Recovery
Disaster recoveryâ€¯refers specifically to restoring the information technology and communications services and systems needed by an organization, both during the period of disruption caused by any event and during restoration of normal services.
