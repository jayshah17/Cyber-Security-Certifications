- To Destruct our data Completely we can use `degausing` - Process of reducing or eliminating an unwanted magnetic field (or data) stored on tap and disk media.

### Data Handling Process

- Classification is the process of recognizing the organizational impacts if the information suffers any security compromises related to its characteristics of confidentiality, integrity and availability. Information is then labeled and handled accordingly.  
- Minimum Classification should be done so that distinguish between set of assets is easier
- Labeling are categorized in
    - Highly restricted: Compromise of data with this sensitivity label could possibly put the organization’s future existence at risk. Compromise could lead to substantial loss of life, injury or property damage, and the litigation and claims that would follow.
    - Moderately restricted: Compromise of data with this sensitivity label could lead to loss of temporary competitive advantage, loss of revenue or disruption of planned investments or activities.
    - Low sensitivity (sometimes called “internal use only”): Compromise of data with this sensitivity label could cause minor disruptions, delays or impacts.
    - Unrestricted public data: As this data is already published, no harm can come from further dissemination or disclosure.
 
- Data Retention: Data retention policies are applicable both for hard copies and for electronic data, and no data should be kept beyond its required or useful life.
- Data that might be left on media after deleting is known as remanence and may be a significant security concern.
- Clearing the device or system, which usually involves writing multiple patterns of random values throughout all storage media (such as main memory, registers and fixed disks). This is sometimes called “overwriting” or “zeroizing” the system,
- Sometimes degaussing may not for clearing the data

### Logging and Monitoring Security Events

- Log reviews are an essential function not only for security assessment and testing but also for identifying security incidents, policy violations, fraudulent activities and operational problems near the time of occurrence.
-  Ingress monitoring refers to surveillance and assessment of all inbound communications traffic and access attempts
    - Tools for Ingress Monitoring:
      - Firewalls
      - Gateways
      - Remote authentication servers
      - IDS/IPS tools
      - SIEM solutions
      - Anti-malware solutions
     
- Egress monitoring is used to regulate data leaving the organization’s IT environment. The term currently used in conjunction with this effort is data loss prevention (DLP) or data leak protection.
     - Egress Monitoring Incidents are:
      - Email (content and attachments)
      - Copy to portable media
      - File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
      - Posting to web pages/websites
      - Applications/application programming interfaces (APIs)


- Organizations must maintain adherence to retention policy for logs as prescribed by law, regulations and corporate governance.
